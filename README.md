# timertweets

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>Timer Tweet is a service to create time locked tweets that only reveal itself in the future.</p>
<h4>Why though?</h4>
<p>It's a ticking timebomb really. If you couple it with some meta information about what the hidden message is, it can be used to reveal any information in a time-bound manner.</p>
<h4>Will the tweet unlock on and display on Twitter as well?</h4>
<p>Not unless Twitter allows us to edit Tweets and opens an API to edit them. They would revealed on this very site.</p>
<h4>What is with the Algorithm and the Proof?</h4>
<p>To make sure the message that is tweeted hasn't been tampered with in any shape or form, a hash of the message is also tweeted out, this can be matched with the hash of the revealed message to ensure the message is indeed the same </p>
<h4>What is hashing?</h4>
<p>Aha! you have asked my favourite made up question.</p>
<p><a href="https://blockgeeks.com/guides/what-is-hashing/">Here </a> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~adamchik/15-121/lectures/Hashing/hashing.html">are </a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMtFhACPnTY">some </a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4b8ktEV4Bg">explainers.</a></p>
<h4>Features planned, Get in touch, etc.</h4>
<p>I am thinking of tying the Twitter Search API in the reveal page to show the original tweet at the time of reveal. I don't know how well that will work. If you want to get in touch about this or something else, I am availible on the <a href="https://raghav.cc/hello/">web </a> and <a href="mailto:hello@raghav.cc">email.</a></p>
